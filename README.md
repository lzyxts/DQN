# DQN
This project implements Deep Q-Learning (DQN) to optimize asset allocation and portfolio rebalance in financial markets. It integrates data from ETFs (QQQ, TLT, GLD, VIXM) and economic indicators sourced from Trading Economics. The goal is to develop an automated trading agent that learns to make optimal decisions based on historical data and current market conditions.
